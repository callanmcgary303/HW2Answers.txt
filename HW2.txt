1.32 put a method in the class and use the code: System.out.println(“name”);
 
1.33 public void Send
{public static void main (String {} args)}
 
1.34 public int Average (int x, int y)
{public static void main (String [] args} 
 
1.35 the book is a class but it has the objects of; BlueJ, 666 pages, textbook, color (blue)
 
1.36 Yes an object can have several different classes to simplify your code like using many primitive data types within the object 
 
2.6 public labClass ()
{ inner part of class }

public Student ()
{ inner part of class}
 
2.11 methods in a class are always kept in () while the two features of the constructor is that they can be private 
and initialize variables also the constructors must be the same as the class and they do not return any value. 
 
2.17 private int status;
{int status;} 
 
2.21 public Pet (String petsName)
{name=name+petsName;} 
 
2.22 public Date(string month, int day, int year)
 
2.23 they both return the object state by returning the value of the stored field variable. The methods are specific like 
“getPrice” gets the price of the ticket and “getBalance” performs a different function because it includes a different method to use the if/else function 
 
2.26 private int Total;
{ getTotal();}
 
2.28 printTicket includes a different method of System.out.println so is can display a text on the terminal/print the 
ticket for the customer. The getPrice method uses a return field to get an int
 
2.29 *They do not have a return statement because they are doing something that does not require 
anything that is needed to be returned. Because both headers have “void”  this suggest there is nothing to return. 
 
2.33 public void increase (int points);
{ return=score+(int points);}
 
2.35 public void discount (int amount);
{ return price = getPrice() - (int amount);}
 
2.37 public ticketmachine (int cost)
{price=cost; 
balance=0; 
total=0; { prompt return void;
System.out.println (“please insert correct amount of money”);
 
2.41 
public void printTicket()
    {       System.out.println("##################");
            System.out.println("# The BlueJ Line");
            System.out.println("# Ticket");
            System.out.println("# " + price + " cents.");
            System.out.println("##################");
            System.out.println();
 
            // Update the total collected with the price.
            total = total + price;
            // Reduce the balance by the prince.
            balance = balance - price;
        }
        else {
	return price;
        System.out.println("The price of the ticket is returnPrice() cents");
                    
        }
